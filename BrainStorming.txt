Assumptions and Planning for Low Power Datalogging.

1. Designing in a way to run microcontroller on battery.
2. To meet our low-power goals, a better choice is a Arduino Nano (ATmega328P @ 5V, 16 MHz) and 3.3V Arduino-compatible board without these overheads.
    1. Why 3.3 V? Running at 3.3 V ensures compatibility with the SD card’s voltage and avoids power lost in level shifters or regulators. The ATmega328P can run at 8 MHz on 3.3 V with full Arduino support. This means we can directly interface the SD card and also benefit from lower active current than a 5 V/16 MHz setup. In summary, using a bare-bones 3.3 V microcontroller (like a Pro Mini) instead of a stock Nano eliminates unnecessary draw from onboard peripherals and is highly recommended for long battery life.
3. For unique file name, I thought about 2 options: 
    1. using the timestamp: It will be unique even after we restart the program.
    2. file counter: Files are unique until we restart the program.
    We are choosing option 1 for this case.
